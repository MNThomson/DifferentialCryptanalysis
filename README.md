# Differential Cryptanalysis

Final project for **ECE 406: Applied Cryptography**.

This project implements differential cryptanalysis to attack a simple cipher,
as outlined in
[Linear Differential Cryptanalysis](https://www.engr.mun.ca/~howard/PAPERS/ldc_tutorial.pdf).
The program utilizes multithreading to enhance performance, making the analysis faster and more efficient.


## Usage

To run the project, use the following command:

```sh
cargo r
```

The `--release` flag builds the binary in release mode, applying optimizations for improved runtime performance.
